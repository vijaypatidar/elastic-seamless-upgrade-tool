        tuning.

  breaking_changes:
  - category: REST API changes
    changes:
    - field: search API fields parameter
      description: The `fields` parameter now normalizes `geo_shape` objects that
        cross the international dateline (e.g. splits a polygon into two).
      impact: If your application requires original (unnormalized) geometries, retrieve

  deprecations:
  - category: Cluster and node setting deprecations
    changes:
    - setting: discovery.type
      details: Legacy values other than `single-node` or `multi-node` are deprecated
        and will be forbidden in a future version.
      impact: Avoid using non-standard values; better to omit this setting to rely
        on default discovery behavior.
  - category: REST API deprecations
    changes:
    - feature: bulk API lenient parsing
      details: Elasticsearch used to silently ignore invalid or malformed bulk action
        lines. That leniency is deprecated and future versions will reject such bulk
        requests.
      impact: Ensure bulk actions are well‑formed JSON objects with a recognized action
        key.
    - feature: index_include_frozen parameter in SQL API
      details: The `index_include_frozen` parameter and the `FROZEN` syntax are deprecated
        following frozen index deprecation.
      impact: Use data tiers instead—unfreeze indices using the unfreeze index API
        and avoid frozen-specific SQL syntax.

      details: Configuring a bind DN in an LDAP or Active Directory realm without
        a corresponding bind password is deprecated.

        specified without a bind_password.

  breaking_changes:
  - category: REST API changes
    changes:
    - change: Bulk API rejects unrecognized actions
      description: Starting in 8.5, the bulk API rejects requests containing unrecognized
        action types (e.g. not `create`, `update`, `index`, or `delete`). Prior versions
        silently ignored them.
      impact: Applications must only send valid action types; malformed bulk requests
        now return 400 Bad Request.

      details: Plugins extending the NetworkPlugin interface are deprecated and won't

      details: Overriding join validators or election strategies via DiscoveryPlugin
        is deprecated.

        future behavior change.
  - category: Cluster and node setting deprecations
    changes:
    - setting: cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold
      details: Values less than `1` are now ignored and will be forbidden in a future
        version.
      impact: Ensure this setting is at least `1`.

    changes:
    - issue: metadata field definitions
      details: Parameters like `type`, `fields`, `copy_to`, and `boost` in metadata

    changes:
    - name: JsonProcessor strict parsing
      description: The ingest node’s `json` processor now rejects invalid JSON by
        default instead of silently dropping trailing invalid content.

        by default for TDigest, offering faster performance but with a small accuracy
        trade‑off.
      impact: 'Percentile results may slightly differ. To retain previous exact behavior,
        set `execution_hint: high_accuracy` per agg, or set `search.aggs.tdigest_execution_hint`
        to `high_accuracy` cluster‑wide.'

  breaking_changes:
  - category: Cluster and node setting changes
    changes:
    - setting: thread_pool.vectortile

        such as `thread_pool.vectortile.size` will cause Elasticsearch to fail startup.
      impact: Remove any `vectortile` thread pool settings from `elasticsearch.yml`.
  - category: Java API changes
    changes:
    - change: Pre-configured analyzer components updated to use `IndexVersion` type
      description: Analysis components now accept `IndexVersion` instead of `Version`,

      impact: Upgrade or recompile custom Java plugins or client integrations referencing
        analyzer APIs.
  deprecations:
  - category: Authorization deprecations

        subobject.
